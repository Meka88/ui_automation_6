06-11-2023 TestNG vs JUnit


Recap:

Page Object Model
-It is a design pattern enables programmers (testers) to store all the elements related to a web page in their respective class (object repository)
-We can also create reusable methods related to this specific page in their respective class
-@FindBy is used to locate elements
-PageFactory and its initElements() method is used in the default contructor to introduce all the web elements with our single driver.


Advantages:
	- Reusable
	- Readability
	- Maintanence of web elements easier

Animal a1; // declaration in the base class

a1 = new Animal(); // initialization in the child class




TestNG:
- Unit testing tool we used for annotations, assertions, reports
- xml files: grouping together the test scripts 
- DataProvider: used to execute same script with different data
- Set priority between tests - ordering purposes
- Help us with parallel testing
- Dependency between test cases




IGNORING SOME TEST SCRIPTs
1. Command out or delete the @Test annotation for the script
	(NOT RECOMMENDED)
2. Use @Ignore annotation on the top of test you would like ignore
	SYNTAX:
		    @Ignore
    		@Test

3. Use enabled=false property next @Test annotation
	SYNTAX: @Test(enabled = false)



DATA PROVIDER ANNOTATION 
-DataProvider annotation is useful when you will execute the same script with different data sets
-It will execute the scripts for each data you povided in the @DataProvider


Syntax:
@DataProvider
public Object[] getData(){
	
}


Login test
Username 		Password 		Message
empty 			empty			Invalid Username entered!
wrong 			correct 		Invalid Username entered!
correct 		wrong 			Invalid Password entered!
wrong 			wrong 			Invalid Username entered!


TestNG Soft Assertions
-Hard assertions: used to stop the execution if there is failure.
-Soft assertions: used to verify expected output but do not pause the script execution till the end. And will attach the failure to the report once all the script is executed.

JUnit vs TestNG
-Initial, JUnit was relased by Apache
-Then, TestNG was released
	TestNG = Test New Generation
-TestNG is more improved version of JUnit
