Test-Driven Framework -> based on TestNG
Tell me about your UI Framework.
-My framework uses Java programming language as its core and all the other tools are designed around it.
-We use Maven as a build and it provides many advantages such as providing pom.xml,  creating profiles, and executing profiles with maven commands.
-Maven also centralize all our dependencies like TestNG, Selenium, WebDriverManager and more in the pom.xml and it makes it easy for us to maintain them with their versions.
-We also utilize Maven surefire reports to be generated after executing our profiles with Maven commands (mvn test -PSmoke)
-We use TestNG in our framework for its advantages like annotations, assertions, DataProvider, xml files, setting priorities and more.
-We use Selenium WebDriver and WebDriverManager to set up the browsers and interact with web elements for our UI scripts.
-We implement design patterns like Singleton to provide a single driver to be used across the project and Page Object Model to centralize all the web elements in their respective classes to increase the reusability, readability and maintanence of the elements in case some locators changing. Not only elements but we also store reusable methods.
-We do have an important package in our framework where we store all the utility classes having methods like setting-quitting driver, reading global configurations, and handling advanced frontend tasks like table-handling, dropdown-handling etc.
-Our framework is designed to handle Cross-Browser testing which is controlled from configuration.properties file where we store all the important global information.
-We execute 2 important suites in our framework and these are Smoke and Regression suites and they are integrated with xml files and maven profiles. Also, we push code to GitLab and the repo is intergrated with Jenkins to automatically trigger the test executions.
-We run Smoke daily at __ AM and Regression at the end of each sprint.
-We currently have 8 Smoke test cases which runs in 5 mins and 540 Regression test cases which run in 3.5 hours.
-Besides all of the above, we use all the OOP principles in our framework to provide the best coding practices and increase the code reusability and readability. One good example is that we have a Base Test class where we execute all the before and after actions and all the other Test classes inheriting these from the Base class.
